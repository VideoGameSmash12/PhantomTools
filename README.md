# PhantomTools - A plugin I created when I was 11
PhantomTools is a legacy plugin I created in 2015 as an attempt to recreate and improve upon my first ever plugin: the VideoCraftPlugin. I stopped working on it a few months later due to the conditions I was facing at the time, but I decided to continue the project 2 and a half years later because of how messy it was.
